# Xojo and OpenCV
### http://opencv.org/

## *This binding requires OpenCV 3.0!*

## Warning
You must use 32-bit version of OpenCV dynamically linked libraries. 
Work under progress at Xojo for 64-bit!

The code is under development. This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied warranty. 

## Getting Started
Very easy. Just unzip the downloaded file and open OpenCVX code with Xojo IDE. Then drag the **OpenCVX folder** to any application requiring OpenCV image processing. **OPenCVX folder** contains different **modules** that give access to numerous OpenCV functions that are declared as External Methods.

Inside each module there is a **constant** (e.g. core, immproc, highgui..) which is linked to  OpenCV libraries. PLease update values according to your platform.


## samples dir
Several programs which demonstrate how to use OpenCV with Xojo are included in the **samples** directory .
These programs allow to play with camera and images.


## enjoy
